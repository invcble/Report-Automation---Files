A few specific things I've noticed:
1) Abdi has managed to build quite an impressive network very early on in his Merck career. He has been able to get exposed to various MMD leaders and they know of him - which is obviously a good thing. He has done this through working on several stretch assignments that would technically fall outside of his scope
2) Another impressive thing I've noticed is how much Abdi is aware of our company, products and strategy. He always tries to link projects to stratetig company objectives. ","Abdi can be considered very direct and straight to the point. He is very competitive, and he wants to win as often as possible. That's not always a bad thing. However, sometimes finnesse is required to sell your vision. Especially when dealing with other direct and competitive colleagues. I have spoken to Abdi about this as he requested feedback prior - and he has shown improvement in this area. But, it would be beneficial for him to put add'l focus on this area. ","Abdi and I have frequent touch points and we are both very much pro feedback. Abdi needs to continue learning, growing and developing. Also, he needs to understand that asking for help is not a bad thing. 

Considering what ive seen from him so far, i am sure he will make it quite far in our org. "

Sometimes these team members would benefit by being held accountable for their deliverables rather than leaning more heavily on Kate. However, I do feel that she models the behaviors and activities that are required to get the job done. So perhaps personnel are learning by seeing her activities. Occasionally Kate can absorb ideas from various leads to synthesize an approach and pressure test it, but it may not be recognized as coming from the team. It is a minor comment that she make sure to recognize these group-synthesized views.

Angela always follows through with her work to make sure every action was achieved, documented, and measured for the future benefit of the team. Angela goes the extra step to make sure all efforts made towards a project have the maximum value to the company. A great example of this ""lead by doing"" attitude is when Angela surveyed the entire S&C global team to get their feedback on their knowledge of sourcing and contracting related topics to gauge the confidence and mastery of employees across all four hubs. With the information she collected, she has presented the training framework implementation strategy for sourcing and contracting to SMLT for 2024 with the intent to focus on the weakest topics from the survey results first. ","Angela is humble. Although she is not shy, she is always willing to let others share their perspective and input before providing hers, making her lack forwardness. Angela is very intelligent and always brings thoughtful insights to discussions. When it comes to working with others, Angela can improve by seeking leadership experience. Through leading the CF 2024 Strategic Initiative Training Framework, Angela will be challenged with managing relationships with her leadership as well as will need to provide guidance to the project team members reporting to her. Angela should continue to seek leadership opportunities where she can master her management style and gain knowledge through experience that can't be taught through mentorship and training alone. 
","Angela is an absolute delight to work with. She is thoughtful, intuitive, friendly, kind, and well-spoken. She leads by example and is constantly seeking the positive outcome to every situation, project, or task at hand. Her caring maternal nature makes those she interacts with feel heard and understood. She is the glue to our team as the subject matter expert in all things sourcing, contracting, Ariba, planning, category management, and so much more. Her bright energy and bubbly personality make people instantly drawn to her. She welcomes anyone and everyone, making sure no one is ever left out. She has grown so much in the past year as far as self advocation. I am sure Angela will be all of our bosses sometime in the near future! As far as final remarks, I hope the leadership team sees the value, talent, and dedication Angela has been providing Merck with for several years and set her up for future success. "

Example: The SMQR (supplier qualification process documentations) which does not belong to procurement RACI but procurement (GP) has been doing all the work for many years and is taking a toll on the team. 3-4 people had left the team/company due to this, where a procurement is basically spending 80-90% of the time doing all this quality work, and not procurement work at all.. even on night time and weekends. Travis together with our Director, Pat managed to escalate this issue up to the higher management and work with the Quality team to get this piece of process to be pushed back to the Quality RACI, and they successfully did it after countless of negotiations and discussions. ","While Travis is a good speaker, being able to speak on-the-go and think effectively and fast, however, in my opinion, his voice is rather soft (or not loud) and sometimes this cannot be heard in a big meeting room or when you need to stress on something important/urgent in the message.

In her role, Linda has consistently demonstrated an extraordinary ability to network and understand the needs of our stakeholders, while also excelling in talent acquisition to keep our team effectively staffed.

Linda's networking skills are truly exceptional. She possesses a natural talent for building and nurturing relationships, which allows her to gain deep insights into the needs and expectations of our stakeholders. Her ability to connect with individuals from various backgrounds and industries has proven to be invaluable in understanding the evolving landscape of our work. Linda's dedication and commitment to networking have cultivated a network of professionals who trust and rely on her expertise and insights.

Linda's talent acquisition skills have consistently ensured that our team remains staffed with highly skilled individuals who are the right fit for our objectives. She possesses a keen eye for identifying talent and has developed an extensive network of professionals in various fields. Linda's ability to assess the strengths and potential of potential candidates is remarkable. She understands not only the technical skills required but also the importance of cultural fit within our team and organization.

In addition to her exceptional networking and talent acquisition skills, Linda is a hardworking and genuinely good person. She consistently goes above and beyond in her efforts to support our team and stakeholders. Her dedication and commitment to excellence are evident in everything she does. Linda's intelligence and ability to quickly grasp new concepts make her a valuable asset to our team. She is someone who can learn anything and adapt to changing circumstances with ease.

It is important to recognize and appreciate Linda's contributions, as they have a profound impact on our team's success. Her remarkable networking and talent acquisition skills, combined with her work ethic, genuine nature, and intelligence, make her an invaluable member of our team.
","While Linda's dedication and thoroughness in your work are commendable, there is an opportunity for improvement in understanding and managing the limits we have on resources. It is crucial for you to recognize the need to prioritize work, sometimes saying ""no"" to stakeholders, and effectively manage the resources at hand.

One of the biggest challenges we have observed is your persistence in seeking additional resources, even when it has been made clear that we are unable to add more at this time. It is essential to recognize that the rest of your peers are also stretched thin, and consistently asking for more resources can create unnecessary strain and lead to burnout.

At a multinational company, it is crucial to strike a balance between meeting stakeholders' needs and managing the available resources effectively. This requires understanding the importance of resource allocation and prioritization. Learning to say ""no"" when necessary and setting realistic expectations is a skill that will greatly benefit you in your role. By managing expectations and communicating limitations to stakeholders, you can streamline activities and prioritize the most critical work.

For example, it is important to work with your peers to understand how project allocation is done from Headquarters. This knowledge will allow you to identify best practices that can be implemented in our China operations, such as convincing GCTO China that not every project needs to be bid on. This will save valuable time and resources. It is crucial to critically evaluate the processes in place and make them more reasonable and manageable, ensuring that resources are not being overburdened.

By effectively managing resources, prioritizing work, and understanding the limitations, you will not only alleviate the strain on yourself and your peers but also impress your senior leadership in RDSP. This skill will undoubtedly contribute to your career growth and help you meet your aspirations.

I encourage you to seek out opportunities for learning and development in resource management and prioritization. It may be beneficial to engage in workshops, training programs, or mentorship opportunities that focus on these areas. Additionally, I suggest having open and honest conversations with your stakeholders to align expectations and establish realistic timelines based on the available resources.

I believe in your potential and your ability to grow in this area. With a balanced and strategic approach to resource management, you will be able to achieve greater efficiency and make a significant impact on our team and organization.
","Linda has made exceptional contributions in her critical role within our organization. Her ability to consistently deliver the needed results is truly remarkable, and we recognize the value you bring to our team and the organization as a whole.

Her role is not an easy one, and we understand the challenges that come with it. However, it is evident that she possess the unique skills, expertise, and dedication that make you the right person for the job. Her commitment to delivering high-quality work and your ability to navigate complex situations are invaluable assets to our team and organization.

RDSP management sees tremendous potential in Linda to be a critical leader within our organization. Her drive, intelligence, and desire for personal growth are evident in all that she does. We believe that addressing the development areas we discussed earlier, particularly in resource management and prioritization, will further enhance your leadership capabilities.

To support your development, we encourage Linda to take advantage of any learning and development opportunities available. This could include attending relevant workshops, seeking mentorship from experienced leaders, and engaging in activities that will enhance your understanding of resource management and effective leadership practices."
